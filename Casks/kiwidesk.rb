  # KiwiDesk carries Sparkle from this version on, so the app
  # updates itself and `brew upgrade` defers to it rather than
  # racing it. Without this stanza both would own the same
  # install: Sparkle overwrites the .app and brew's manifest goes
  # stale, reporting the version it installed while a newer one
  # is on disk. `--greedy` still forces an upgrade for anyone who
  # wants brew to stay in charge.
